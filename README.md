# Spectral Alerts

Spectral alerts describe a MS2 pattern that can be linked to substructures of hazardous compounds and can be seen as the pendant of structural alerts for MS2 spectra.

The spectral alerts presented were mined with MS2LDA 2.0 and the publication can be found here.

## Why use them?

- querying for spectral alerts is quick!

- allows to narrow down the sample size by 98%!

- easy to interpret and further analyze flagged features!

- caveat: Check if your substructures of interest are part of the spectral alerts! We focused on pesticides. The workflow provided can also be applied on different compound classes.

## How to use them?

- git clone ...

- cd spectral alerts

- pip install requirements.txt

- if you are into computational mass spectrometry: the Mass2Motifs are available in .. format
