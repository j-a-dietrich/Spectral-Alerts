# ⚡ Spectral Alerts

Spectral Alerts describe MS² fragmentation patterns that can be linked to toxicologically relevant substructures. Think of them as the MS² counterpart of structural alerts 🧩 — but for spectra!

The Spectral Alerts presented here were mined using MS2LDA 2.0 and are intended to be used for nontarget screening workflows for pesticides and contaminantes.

## ✨ Why use Spectral Alerts?

⚡ Fast querying – instantly match alerts in your data

🎯 Efficient filtering – reduce your candidate space by up to 98%

🔍 Transparent interpretation – alerts are easy to explain and explore

⚠️ Important caveat: make sure your substructures of interest are covered.
Our initial focus was pesticides, but the workflow can be extended to other compound classes.
